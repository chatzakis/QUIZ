# The X quiz project
The X Quiz is an engaging Node.js application where players can choose from various categories and difficulty levels to embark on a quick 10-question quiz. 
The questions are randomly selected on demand from the [TRIVIA API](https://the-trivia-api.com) based on the player's preferences. 
Upon completing the quiz, the game presents the player with their final score, providing an enjoyable and educational experience.
